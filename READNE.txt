I have included the notebook files that i used for this project. They contian all the code used for training and viewing the results.
The dataset has to be downloaded to view any results, it can downloaded at the followingn link:

*make sure to specify the right path wherever indicated in the code

### models

Obviosly, am not expecting that you run the trainng process again and thus, I uploaded all trained models to one drive at the following link:

### files included are:

'Getting_results_kernel' notebook can be used to load and run the models

'make-pneumothorax-classifer-data' , 'make-pneumothorax-oneCase-data' these two are used to create 2 more datasets for classifier and one case model

'pneumothorax fastai 5-fold U-Net 128x128 (1)' runs training for segmentation models

'pneumothorax-classifier' runs training for classifier model

**Folder 'python files' contains the raw python files in case there isn't access to juptyer environment
*** Folder 'some results' contains some graphs that were exracted from the notebooks to show results of training
